== Best Practices ==
* add documentation on each Category and each Property page
* all used categories and properties must be defined
* property pages must contain a Datatype annotation
* property pages should contain a hint describing the objects for which they can be used
* there should be one form for each category that should be manually created/modified
** the name of the form should be similar/equal to the category name
** e.g. [[Form:Molecule]]
* there should be one template for each category/form that is populated by the form
** the name of the template should be similar/equal to the category name
** e.g. [[Template:Molecule]]
* the template pages should be documented and the expected parameters should be described in the '''noinclude''' section
* some forms have parameters that should not be modified, nevertheless it is often beneficial to show them in read-only mode in the form
* ideally each page contains exactly one template and is fully specified by this template and all its parameters
** exceptions are the publication and information pages, which are free text
