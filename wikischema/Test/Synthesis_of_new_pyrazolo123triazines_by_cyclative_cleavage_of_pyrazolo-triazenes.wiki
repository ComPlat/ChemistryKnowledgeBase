NMR spectra of dissolved samples were recorded on a Bruker Ascend 400 at 21 °C. Chemical shifts (''δ'') are expressed in parts per million (ppm) downfield from tetramethylsilane (TMS). References for <sup>1</sup>H NMR and <sup>13</sup>C NMR were the residual solvent peaks of chloroform-''d<sub>1</sub>'' (<sup>1</sup>H: ''δ'' = 7.26 ppm; <sup>13</sup>C: ''δ'' = 77.0 ppm) if not stated otherwise. All coupling constants (''J'') are absolute values and are expressed in Hertz (Hz). The description of signals includes: s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, m = multiplet, dd = doublet of doublets, and ddd = double doublet of doublets and so forth. The spectra were analyzed according to the first order. The assignments of the signal structure in <sup>1</sup>H NMR were made by the detected multiplicity and for <sup>13</sup>C NMR by DEPT 90- and DEPT 135-spectra (DEPT = Distortionless Enhancement by Polarization Transfer) and are described as follows: + = primary or tertiary C‑atom (positive DEPT-signal), – = secondary C-atom (negative signal) and C<sub>q</sub> = quaternary C-atom (no signal). Furthermore, 2D experiments such as COSY (Correlated Spectroscopy) and HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) were performed.

IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Alpha ATR spectrometer. The compounds were measured as pure substances by the ATR (ATR = attenuated total reflection) technique. The position of the absorption band is given in wave numbers ''ṽ'' in cm<sup>-1</sup>. The intensities of the bands were characterized as follows: vs = very strong (0–20% T), s = strong (21–40 % T), m = medium (41–60% T), w = weak (61–80% T), vw = very weak (81–100% T).

Mass spectra were measured by EI-MS (electron impact mass spectrometry) and were recorded on a Finnigan MAT 95. The peaks are given as mass-to-charge-ratio (''m/z''). The molecule peak is given as [M]<sup>+</sup> and characteristic fragment peaks are given as [M–fragment]<sup>+</sup> or [fragment]<sup>+</sup>. The signal intensities are given in percent, relatively to the intensity of the base signal (100%). For the high resolution mass, the following abbreviations were used: Calcd = calculated data, Found = measured data. The software of FAB and EI adds the mass of one electron.

Analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out on Merck silica gel coated aluminum plates (silica gel 60, F<sub>254</sub>), detected under UV-light at 254 nm or stained with “Seebach staining solution” (mixture of molybdato phosphoric acid, cerium(IV)-sulfate tetrahydrate, sulfuric acid and water) or basic potassium permanganate solution. Solvent mixtures are understood as volume/volume.

All solvents, reagents and chemicals were used as purchased unless stated otherwise.

Air- or moisture-sensitive reactions were carried out under argon atmosphere in oven-dried and previously evacuated glass ware. Liquids were transferred with plastic syringes and steel cannula. Silica gel 60 (0.040 × 0.063 mm, Geduran®, Merck) was used as stationary phase and solvents of ''p.a.'' quality were used as mobile phase.

InChI Strings were generated with InChI Version (1.04), Smiles with the SMILES Version of Daylight.

To a mixture of 5-amino-1H-pyrazole-4-carbonitrile (2.00 g, 19 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in 6 mL of water, conc. hydrochloric acid (6.17 mL, 74 mmol, 4.00 equiv) was added. The mixture was cooled to 0 °C and a solution of sodium;nitrite (1.91 g, 28 mmol, 1.50 equiv) in 20 mL of water was added. Additional 10 mL of water were added to get a stirrable slurry. After stirring for 30 min at 0 °C, a mixture of diisopropylamine (2.43 g, 3.37 mL, 24 mmol, 1.30 equiv) and dipotassium carbonate (5.11 g, 37 mmol, 2.00 equiv) in 50 mL of water were added. The reaction mixture was stirred at 21 C until TLC showed that all diazonium salt had disappeared. The reaction mixture was extracted with 3 × 150 mL of DCM. Some precipitate was formed between the layers which had to be filtered off (clogged the frit). The combined organic phases were washed with 3 × 60 mL of water, dried over sodium sulfate and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to give the desired product. The obtained crude product was purified ''via'' flash-chromatography on silica gel using cyclohexane/ethyl acetate 4:1 to 2:1 to give the target compound in 45% yield (1.85 g, 8.4 mmol).

The solution was cooled to 0 °C before lithium aluminum hydride (43.9 mg, 1.16 mL, 1.16 mmol, 3.00 equiv) was slowly added. The cooling was removed and the solution was stirred at 21 °C for 14 hours, then additional 5 hours at 50 °C. The solution was cooled to 21 °C and the reaction was quenched with a saturated K/Na-tartrate solution (40 mL). The organic solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the remaining aqueous phase was extracted with methylene chloride (3 × 40 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with brine (100 mL) and dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to give the crude (E)-(1-benzyl-3-(3,3-diisopropyltriaz-1-en-1-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)methanamine ('''18a'''), which was used for the next step without further purification.

The cooling was removed and the solution was stirred for 14 hours at 21 °C. The reaction was quenched with a saturated K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>-solution (40 mL) and the organic solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The remaining aqueous phase was extracted with methylene chloride (3 × 40 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with brine (100 mL) and dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.

The single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies were carried out on a Bruker D8 Venture diffractometer with PhotonII detector at 123(2) K using Cu-Ka radiation (l = 1.54178 Å). Dual space methods (SHELXT) [G. M. Sheldrick, ''Acta Crystallogr.'' 2015, '''A71''', 3-8] were used for structure solution and refinement was carried out using SHELXL-2014 (full-matrix least-squares on ''F<sup>2</sup>'') [G. M. Sheldrick, ''Acta Crystallogr.'' 2015, '''C71''', 3-8]. Hydrogen atoms were localized by difference electron density determination and refined using a riding model. Semi-empirical absorption corrections were applied. For '''12h''' an extinction correction was applied.

= 5. Biological Assays =


Biological assays were carried out under sterile conditions using the sterile benches LaminAir® HB2448 (Heraeus GmbH), Laminar-Flow Werkbank (BDK Luft- und Reinraumtechnik GmbH) or Clean Air Technik (Clean Air). Cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO<sub>2,</sub> and 85% humidity using a Binder Ex-Demo Units Incubator.

'''Cell culture'''

Human epithelial cervix carcinoma (HeLa) cells were cultivated in ''Dulbecco ́s Modified Eagle Medium-high glucose'' (DMEM, Gibco<sup>TM</sup>) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S). At 80% confluency, the medium was removed, the cells were washed with ''Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline'' (DPBS, Gibco<sup>TM</sup>) and treated with trypsin / EDTA (Gibco<sup>TM</sup>) to passage the cells. The detachment process was stopped with culture medium (DMEM + 10% FBS + 1% P/S) and the cells were seeded according to the desired cell number / area.

'''MTT-assay<sup>[1]</sup>'''

In a 96-well plate (Corning<sup>®</sup> Costar<sup>®</sup> 3596 96-Well Cell Culture Cluster), 1.0 × 10<sup>4</sup> HeLa-cells per well of a 96 well plate were cultivated for 16 h. Stock solutions of the single compounds in dimethylsulfoxide were diluted to 0.50 µm, 1.00 µm, 5.00 µm, 10.0 µm, 25.0 µm, and 50.0 µm with cell culture medium (DMEM + 10% FBS + 1% P/S) to ensure a final concentration of DMSO below 0.5%. 100 µL of the prepared DMEM-diluted compounds were added to each well and the cells were incubated for 72 h. All experiments were performed in triplicates. Cells that were solely treated with the culture medium containing 0.5% of DMSO served as a negative control. After incubation, the positive control (cells in DMEM plus 0.5% DMSO) was treated with 1% Triton-X. To determine the viability of the cells 20 µL of a freshly prepared solution of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, 2.73 mg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich<sup>®</sup>) in culture medium were added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The reaction was stopped using 100 µL of ''Solubilization Solution / Stop Mix'' (CellTiter 96<sup>®</sup> Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay, Promega). After 72 h, the absorption (A) of every well at 595 nm was monitored using a 96-well plate reader (Ultra Microplate Reader ELx808, Biotech Instruments Inc.). Graphic evaluation using a dose response fitting was carried out with the help of the software OriginPro<sup>®</sup> 2021. IC<sub>50</sub> values were calculated with Excel.
