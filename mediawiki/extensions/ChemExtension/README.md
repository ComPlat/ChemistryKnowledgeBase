# ChemExtension
This extension contains all functionality related to handle scientific chemistry publications in MediaWiki. Main
focus lies on displaying and editing of molecules. Additionally, we support authoring of investigations which are
sets of experiments. They can be entered in a structured way and queried by the system to be displayed on overview pages.
Finally, we support literature references which are a necessity in scientific publications, and we integrate the common
database "PubChem" to populate the wiki automatically with data about molecules.
