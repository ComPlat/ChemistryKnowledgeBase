==== How to replace a molecule in the wiki ====
(because it is faulty or there are other issues)

===== Molecule just looks weird, but is correct: =====

* log in (with role “editor”)
* go to molecule page, click “modify molecule” in the top right
* This opens the Modify molecule special page with the molecule pre-loaded in the editor
* redraw the molecule correctly, '''it must have the same InChIKey'''!
* Save with “modify molecule” on the bottom of the page

===== Molecule is faulty (missing charge, wrong CO bond, missing counter ion, too many H…) =====

# Set template “Faulty molecule” on page (Insert > Templates > Faulty molecule)
# Open molecule page
# Remove abbreviation (save for later use on correct molecule)
# Check section “Molecule is used on following pages”
## Topic: mostly in investigation link → will change automatically with investigation, if chemform or molecule link, replace with correct molecule link
## Publication: usually chemform or molecule link, replace
## Investigation: must be changed in investigation form
# Check if molecule is part of a collection
## if the base is wrong, redo the whole collection, check for each individual molecule
## if one R-group is wrong, change it where the collection is drawn (add new correct R-group)
# With an overview on which pages it needs to be changed you can proceed:
## on the original (publication) page where the molecule was drawn, create a new chemform with the correct molecule structure (or molecule link)
## delete the faulty chemform (or molecule link)
## save the page
## go to the new molecule page and add the abbreviation
## on pages with investigations, edit the lines mentioning the molecule (remove old with little x at end of line, add new molecule ID or abbreviation, '''select the molecule proposed! Molecule entry must be Molecule:100xxx''')
## remove “Faulty molecule” banner if all is corrected
## Save page: add “Fixed faulty molecule” or something similar in summary
## Repeat on as many pages as necessary
# Add “new” molecule to the [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fxYfQA3uo5vMaVXReY5LyyusimdM_poe74K4oQD9hu8/edit#gid=0 list]  
## enter “ok” in “valid structure”
## link to new molecule from old molecule in “redirect”
# Check old molecule page: it should have an empty “Molecule is used on following pages” section (or only test pages)
